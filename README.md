## Installation Guide

Choose the method that works best for you. **Option 1 (Python Script)** is recommended for most users.

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended)

This method uses a simple script that sets everything up automatically.

#### Step 1: Install Python

You need Python 3.10 or newer installed on your computer.

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

1. Open **Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter)
2. Check if Python is installed by typing: `python3 --version`
3. If not installed, download from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer
4. During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

1. Download Python from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer
3. **Important:** Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking Install
4. Click "Install Now"

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)</strong></summary>

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

</details>

#### Step 2: Download the Software

**Option A: Download ZIP (easiest)**
1. Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page
2. Click **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., your Desktop or Documents)

**Option B: Using Git (if you have it installed)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nima-Sarfaraz/Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter.git
```

#### Step 3: Run the Application

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS / Linux</strong></summary>

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master
   ```
   > **Note:** The folder may be named `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master` or `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter` depending on how you downloaded it.
3. Make the script executable (first time only):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
5. Your browser will open automatically to the app

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

1. Open the folder where you extracted the files
2. Double-click **`start.bat`**
3. A command window will open and set things up (this may take a minute the first time)
4. Your browser will open automatically to the app

**Alternative:** If double-clicking doesn't work:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master
   ```
   > **Note:** The folder may be named `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master` or `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter` depending on how you downloaded it.
3. Run: `start.bat`

</details>

The script automatically:
- Creates an isolated Python environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Starts the server
- Opens your web browser to the app

**To stop the application:** Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal/command window.

### Option 2: Docker (Alternative)

Docker is a containerization platform that packages the app with all its dependencies. This is useful if you're familiar with Docker or want complete isolation.

#### Step 1: Install Docker

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully load

#### Step 2: Download the Software

**Option A: Download ZIP (easiest)**
1. Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page
2. Click **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., your Desktop or Documents)

**Option B: Using Git (if you have it installed)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nima-Sarfaraz/Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter.git
```

#### Step 3: Run with Docker

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS / Linux</strong></summary>

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master
   ```
   > **Note:** The folder may be named `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master` or `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter` depending on how you downloaded it.
3. Run Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

1. Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master
   ```
   > **Note:** The folder may be named `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter-master` or `Soft-Agar-Colony-Counter` depending on how you downloaded it.
3. Run Docker:
   ```
   docker compose up
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

</details>

**To stop:** Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## How to Use

Once the application is running in your browser:

1. **Upload Images** — Drag and drop your TIFF, PNG, or JPG files into the upload area (or click to browse)
2. **Adjust Parameters** — Use the sliders on the left to tune detection sensitivity. Changes preview live.
3. **Review & Edit** — Switch between View/Add/Remove modes to manually correct any missed or false colonies by clicking on the annotation image itself (left). Counts are updated on the right side.
4. **Move Between Files** - Click on the next file/image on the file browser to the right
5. **Export Results** — Click "Export CSV" to download a spreadsheet with colony counts for all images when finished with all files/images

**Tips:**
- Use the **Split View** to see both your image and the detection mask side-by-side
- The mask shows what the algorithm "sees" — white regions are potential colonies
- Parameters are saved per-image, so you can tune each one individually

## Features

- **Web UI:** Browser-based interface with drag-and-drop upload, live parameter tuning, and manual annotation
- **CLI:** Batch processing for automated workflows (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLI usage)
- **FastAPI Backend:** REST API for programmatic access

## Example Data

`examples/data/` contains sample HepG2 and Huh7 plate images for testing and demos.

## Security Notice

This project takes supply-chain security seriously. In light of recent npm ecosystem
attacks, we've implemented several protective measures:

### Recommended Deployment Methods (Safest First)

1. **One-Click Script** (Recommended): Uses pre-built frontend and creates isolated Python venv
2. **Pre-built frontend**: The `frontend/dist/` directory is committed to git, so non-Node users can run immediately
3. **Docker**: Runs in an isolated container (convenient for container workflows)
4. **Local build**: Uses `npm ci` for deterministic installs from lockfile

### Security Measures Implemented

- **Locked dependencies**: All npm packages pinned to exact versions
- **Deterministic installs**: Start scripts use `npm ci` (not `npm install`)
- **Install scripts disabled**: `frontend/.npmrc` sets `ignore-scripts=true`
- **Local-only binding**: Server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default

For more information on npm supply-chain security, see:
[Snyk's npm security guide](https://snyk.io/blog/ten-npm-security-best-practices/)

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 8000
lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Docker build fails:**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Try `docker compose build --no-cache`

**Frontend not loading:**
- Check that `frontend/dist/` exists
- Try stopping and re-running `start.sh` or `start.bat`

**Python dependency issues:**
```bash
# Clean reinstall
rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[api]"
```
